**(a)**, **Particle diversity and industry applications**: Ranging from nanoparticles (1\,nm to 100\,nm) like gold and silica crucial in medical therapies and drug delivery, to microparticles (0.1\,$\mu$m to 100\,$\mu$m) such as polymer spheres and cells important in slow-release medications and biological research. Granules (100\,$\mu$m to 2\,mm), used in sectors from agriculture to cleaning, and coarse particles (2\,mm to 10\,mm) such as sand and gravel, are essential in construction and environmental management.
**(b)**, **Overview of particle vision analysis**: This discipline focuses on the detection, segmentation, tracking, classification, and super-resolution imaging of particles. It utilizes advanced algorithms and imaging techniques to analyze particles ranging from microscopic cell structures to larger environmental samples, with applications spanning materials science, pharmaceuticals, environmental science, food and beverage, and aerospace.
**(c)**, **Scientific discovery and optimization cycle via particle vision analysis**: Initiating with exploration tasks like drug discovery, material synthesis, and catalyst design, this cycle progresses through experimentation where observations and data are gathered and analyzed with advanced particle imaging techniques. The feedback loop from these experiments drives further refinements, enhancing insights or optimizing conditions, thus promoting continuous advancement in various fields.
